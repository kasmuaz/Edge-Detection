# Edge-Detection


This was done as a project in graduate course Digital Image Processing. In documentation I presented 
why derivatives arise as 'natural' tool for edge detection. Furthermore, I have explained approximations
of first and second order derivatives for image (2D discrete signal) and how are they used for edge detection.
There is also explanation of Canny edge detector.

Project is implemented in Matlab and I have provided here images after applying various detection techniques.
